<h2><a href="blog/the-ted-approach-to-education.html">The TED Approach to Education</a></h2>
<div class='info'>
by Mike Helsby on 2014-03-02
</div>
<div class='content'>
As TEDxUW
quickly approaches, and the various efforts involved in producing and promoting
the event near conclusion, I find myself reflecting on the nature of TED
itself. It’s strange to think how much and how quickly the TED idea has grown
in the public conscience in such a short time. TED-talks have only been
available online since 2006, but they’ve quickly become one of the primary
sources by which we become informed on a massive variety of subjects pertaining
to the current state and direction of human culture. Any regular or
semi-regular viewer of TED-talks will testify to a wide range of positive
aspects about the conferences, such as their inclusivity, their diversity, and
their intellectual benefits. But it occurs to me that a TED-talk has much in
common with a classroom lecture, specifically with regards to structure and
intention. By this I mean that both are ostensibly comprised of an “expert”
“lecturing” “students” (take the quotation marks how you will) with the
intention of informing and inspiring the audience. I think it’s fair to say
that most of us recognize one of these institutions as coming much closer to
achieving their intentions than the other. I don’t know if many people would be
surprised when I say that, as a grad student and as an avid TED-viewer, I am
often more interested, more inspired and more informed in the fifteen or so
minutes that I spend watching a TED-talk than I am in a three-hour university
lecture. I’m not out to criticize or berate our current education system,
enough people make good money doing that already. But I am interested in how
the differences between these two “educating” entities affect how successfully
they inform and inspire.

<br><span><br>By way of trampling
on my own feet, and as a small apology for my previous remarks to all the good
professors I’ve had the pleasure of learning under, my comparison will be
framed by the ideas of a nineteenth-century writer whose words I would
certainly have never read were it not for my university education. John Henry
Newman was one of the most controversial and foremost intellects of his day. Though
he is best known for his <i>Grammar of
Assent</i>, and rightly so, his <i>Idea of a
University</i> is the single most important text on the theory of education
since Aristotle’s <i>Politics</i>, or so
I’ve been taught by people who apparently know these things. To put it another
way, Newman’s thoughts on education are the most influential in that realm
since the beginnings of Western thought. It was his opinion that it is the duty
of a University to promote development towards what he termed the “Illative
sense” within each individual. This sense goes beyond the acquisition and
storage of knowledge, informing a person’s ability to systematize their
knowledge into an inter-related whole and conduct themselves according to the
dictates of that internal, intellectual “culture” in all situations. The term
“wisdom” could be said to approximate it, but I think Newman means something
less ambiguous by it. In <i>Idea of a
University</i>, he goes on to posit that cultivating this sort of intellect and
inspiring each person to continue this development in their own lives is the <i>only</i> task of the University.</span>

<br><br>Apologies for the somewhat lengthy quote:

<br><span><br>In
default of a recognized term, I have called the
perfection or virtue of the intellect by the name of philosophy,
philosophical knowledge, enlargement of mind, or
illumination;… but, whatever name we bestow on it, it is, I believe, as a
matter of history, the business of a University to make this intellectual
culture its direct scope, or to employ itself in the education of the
intellect… I say, a University, taken in its bare idea… has this object and
this mission; it contemplates neither moral
impression nor mechanical production; it professes
to exercise the mind neither in art nor in duty; its function is intellectual
culture; here it may leave its scholars, and it has done its work when it has
done as much as this. It educates the intellect to reason well in all matters,
to reach out towards truth, and to grasp it.</span>

<br><span><br>Newman despised the university-system of
his day. He accused it of teaching students only how to acquire and regurgitate
shallow information. According to him, students in these nineteenth-century
schools learned “many things badly, and not one thing well”. Anyone acquainted
with current education-reform themes and rhetoric will surely find these
sentiments familiar.&nbsp; According to
Newman, students would be better off congregating in a single location for four
years with no instructors, no curriculum, and no hierarchy than they were in
their current state. Inherent in his analysis are what I believe to be the keys
to TED’s success. </span>

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>TED
operates outside any judgemental structures. Grading and examinations force
students to understand large quantities of information quickly and, often,
superficially. With these demands removed, TED audience-members are free to
naturally ingest the information that is most interesting and relevant to their
situation. The audience walks away with what Newman calls “real” (as opposed to
“notional”) apprehension of the propositions they’ve just received.</span>

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>TED
is concise, and audience-specific. Strict timeframes force speakers to be as
informative, engaging, and instructive as possible in a short amount of time.
There is no room for tangent, redundancy, or overwhelming description of
context. Every second of the less-than-eighteen-minute presentation is entirely
relevant to the single subject under discussion, a subject which each audience
member chose specifically to engage with. So the “inattention epidemic”, if I
may call it that, which has become such a focus for education reformers in recent
years is entirely absent from the TED world. </span>

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Finally,
there is an underlying structure within the TED community that bears a striking
resemblance to Newman’s “Illative Sense”. TED is universal. It has the broadest
of agendas. It is about connecting people with people as much as it is about
connecting ideas with ideas. If I may be allowed a slightly liberal stretch,
TED does for culture and community what the “Illative sense” does for the
intellect. TED functions as a compendium of great ideas spoken by great people;
it connects them, inter-relating and systematizing them for access by a global
audience whose perspectives and actions are molded by the “internal culture” it
represents. I think Newman would be thrilled by, and may even take some credit
for, the framework and concept of TED. Spreading ideas, <i>grasping at truth</i>, injecting our own individualism into a body that
shapes and is shaped by it and all others, not with a goal of perfection, but
with an eye towards always <i>perfecting</i>
how we think and who we are: this is the dream of Newman and the success of
TED.&nbsp;</span>

<div class='content'>
February's almost over, which means we're one step closer to
2014's TEDxUW!&nbsp; With less than three
weeks until the big event, it's time to dish the Truly Exciting Details on this
year's TEDx talk. 

&nbsp;

<br><br><b>The Event</b>

TEDxUW will be held at the Tannery Event Centre in Downtown
Kitchener on March 15, but don't be discouraged if you can't make it. The event
will be livestreamed for those who want to watch online, and of course videos
of the event will be available afterwards. 

&nbsp;

<br><b><br>The Theme </b>

<span>The theme of this year's event is <i>“</i>Ideas worth
spreading”, which probably sounds familiar to anyone who knows TED's general
slogan. This year is all about staying true to what made TED such a successful
phenomenon in the first place — taking great ideas and putting them out on a
forum where people can listen to them, and be inspired. </span>

&nbsp;

<br><b><br>The Speakers </b>

As usual, to present these wonderful ideas, TEDxUW has
assembled an amazing group of speakers from all walks of life. Here's a rundown
on the speakers you can look forward to this year: 

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Paul Salvini:</u>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To say that Dr. Salvini knows a thing or two about computer
science would probably be an understatement. As the chief technological officer
of Christie Digital Systems Canada and former CTO of Side Effects Software, as
well as Adjunct Professor in the Graduate School of Computer Science at the
University of Toronto, he has lots&nbsp;of experience in technology and successful
business ventures. 

But before all his high-level positions, before he won the
Top 40 Under 40 Canadian leadership award, before he received his MASc, MBA and
Ph.D. Engineering degrees at the University of Toronto, he was getting his&nbsp;BMath in
Computer Science here at UW, and he's the president of UW's own Alumni Council,
making it all the more thrilling that he's speaking at this year's TEDxUW. 

&nbsp;<br>

<br><u>Dave Wilkin:</u>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you want to talk serial entrepreneurship, Dave Wilkin is
your man. With founder of Ten Thousand Coffees and co-chair of the Cannes Lions
Young Marketers jury under his belt, among other accomplishments, Wilkin has
his fair share of entrepreneurial experience and is always looking for new
opportunities to change the way global organizations interact with the young
minds of today. 

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Frank Gu:</u> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Gu has had quite a few prestigious names attached to his
quest for knowledge. Getting his BSc at Trent University before getting his
Ph.D. at Queen's, Gu received a NSERC postdoctoral fellowship which let him do
research at MIT and Harvard. In 2008, he became an assistant professor in UW's
Department of Chemical Engineering, and landed a position on the Canadian
Research Chair in 2012 in his area of expertise, nanotechnology. Couple his vast knowledge with his work on over 100 scientific publications and 15 US and
global patents, and you can be sure that he has a lot of wisdom to share. 

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Mike Kirkup:</u>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A man who needs little introduction, Mike Kirkup is the
director of Velocity, UW's designated startup incubator. In his ten years of
experience, Kirkup has been involved with startups like MappedIn and Thalmic
Labs, among other successful businesses. On top of that, Kirkup has had plenty
of experience at uWaterloo, completing his bachelor's degree and his Masters at
the school. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Ginny Dybenko:</u>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The executive director of the UW Stratford Campus, Ginny
Dybenko is known for looking at how interactive media, international commerce,
and human culture interact. With prior work as a VP of Bell Canada and the founding president of
Bell Advanced Communications, it's hardly surprising that she's made the
Women's Executive Network's list of the
top 100 women in Canada, and she is a fantastic addition to the TEDxUW roster. 

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Rod Regier:</u>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Regier's interest in planning has taken him all across
Canada: from the University to Winnipeg, where he received his Honours
bachelor's degree in Geography, to UW, where he earned his Masters in Regional
Planning, to Newfoundland and Labrador, where he worked on many different areas
of planning and development for over 15 years. Today, Regier is the executive
director of economic development for the City of Kitchener, and is involved
with projects like Start Up City, Cluster Development, and the Innovation
District. 

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Aaron Grant:</u>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Aaron Grant is one of the co-founders of Thalmic Labs, a
renowned K-W startup that's best known for creating the MYO digital controller.
As a UW grad whose innovative tech company is located right in the
Kitchener-Waterloo region, Grant is an excellent example of the brilliant minds
on display at TEDxUW conferences. 

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Christina Marchand:</u>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The final speaker is Christina Marchand, who is actually an
undergrad at the University of Waterloo right now! In her fourth year of UW's
health sciences program, Marchand has still had a lot of experience through the
university's co-op program, which has allowed her to work at places like St.
Michael's hospital and with the Save the Mothers program situated in Uganda.
Motivated by her experiences in Uganda, Marchand has also co-founded FullSoul
Canada, a business that sells luxury items to raise money for medical supplies
for Ugandan hospitals. For all her humanitarian efforts, she&nbsp; was awarded the YMCA International Peace
Medallion last fall — not bad for someone who hasn't even finished university
yet. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<br><span><br>On top of all these fantastic speakers, the TEDxUW
conference offers awesome activities, a unique atmosphere, and of course, great
food. Sound good to you? Fortunately, it's not too late to apply for the TEDxUW
conference and get it on all the fun! Applications can be submitted at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://apply.tedxuw.com/">http://apply.tedxuw.com</a> </span>

<h2><a href="blog/6-tedxuw-videos-you-have-to-watch.html">6 TEDxUW Videos you have to watch</a></h2>
<div class='info'>

Only a month to go before TEDxUW 2014!
In case you want to know what kind of excellent speeches you can look
forward to this year, here are 6 talks from past TEDxUW conferences
that you have to see TODAY. These inspirational, eye-opening talks
are a great way to give you a motivational boost, and they're a great
display of the talented people in the KW region. 

<br><u><br></u>“<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKHTawgyKWQ">Why you will fail to have a great
career</a>” — Larry Smith
In this incredibly popular TEDx talk,
UW professor Larry Smith sets the audience straight about their
dreams of a “great career”. Combining humour with harsh truths,
this video warns you about the traps your own mind will set to stop
you on your quest to success. The standout talk was held in TEDxUW's
first conference in 2011, and inspired the next talk about a year
afterwards: 

<br><br>“<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNQRRsL3R4A">Why you have to fail to have a great
career</a>” — Michael Litt
While Professor Smith's talk was
focused on avoiding the causes of failure, this talk is all about
embracing it. Local entrepreneur Michael Litt took the stage in the
QNC during the 2012 TEDxUW conference to let you know that failure
isn't as scary as it's made out to be. Talking about his early years
as an entrepreneur and UW student, Litt narrates a disastrous sales
pitch he experienced, and tells viewers why sometimes, failure is
just the thing you need.<br>&nbsp; 

<br>“<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riHi4BLTrbI">The point where everything falls
apart</a>” — Bill Thompson 

Both of the above videos view failure
as a stepping stone, an obstacle which has to be overcome in order to
achieve success. Of course, when you're facing failure in the face,
sometimes it seems less like a stone and more like a mountain. In
entrepreneur Bill Thompson's career as a bartender, he met more than
a few people who were down on their luck, who had hit a wall; the
goal was within sight, but all of a sudden, they had no idea where
they were going. In this tough love speech, Thompson encourages
people to push forward, and to realize that giving up is not the
answer. 

<br><br>“<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiPcxhJtuPQ">Here's how you get a job at the UN</a>”
— Tanya DeMello
Want to make a change in the world
around you? Then you have to check out Tanya DeMello's TEDxUW talk.
As a United Nations field officer, DeMello definitely knew what she
was talking about when she gave this speech in 2011, which focuses on
the ways you can improve the lives of others. With a title like
“Here's how you get a job at the UN”, you might expect a
step-by-step instructional on working your way up the corporate
ladder until you land a gig with the United Nations. Instead, Demello
gives a touching plea to stop focusing on impressive resumes or
important references — it's all about caring, and putting in real
effort to make the world a better place. 

<br><br>“<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-HBXYWduYA">The poetry of physics, dancing and
life</a>” — Krister Shalm
You probably wouldn't expect a quantum
physicist to be discussing poetry and dance moves, but that's exactly
what you're going to find in this TEDx talk given by Krister Shalm.
This talk encompasses Shalm's transition from an English buff to a
physics major, where he points out that maybe the two subjects really
aren't so different after all, and they're both important in
understanding your place in the universe. 

<br><br>“<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mAFFtVV5B4">Who can you trust?</a>” — Andrew
Maxwell
<span>While a lot of business lectures may
hinge on products or business models, there's not enough of a focus
on the people involved in business themselves. In “Who can you
trust?”, entrepreneurial professor Andrew Maxwell tries to change
this, by dedicating his speech towards figuring out which kinds of
people you can rely on, and how to make others rely on you. Whether
you want to know how to make a successful sales pitch or just be able
to tell if your friends are trustworthy, there's a lesson to be
learned in this TEDx talk. It also features a British accent,
<i>Dragon's Den </i>and heavily
paraphrased Shakespeare, meaning there's a little something here for
everyone.</span>&nbsp;<span><br>

<i><b><br>Did you miss us?</b></i><br><br>After taking 2013 off, TEDxUW is coming back this March to
bring the best in technology, entertainment and design to the Waterloo
community.<br><br>Wondering just what TEDx is? It's an independent branch of
TED that takes the “spreading ideas” mission of the globally-renowned TED
conferences and implements it on a community level, presenting innovative ideas
to locals while also being available online to the world at large. Thousands of
TEDx events are held all across the world, including places like Toronto,
Cambridge — the British one —, Egypt and Sydney. But you're not here to read
about TEDx stuff happening across the pond or down under. Let's talk about our very own TEDx event — TEDxUW.<br><br><span>The University of Waterloos' TEDx
conference has all the benefits of all the other TED talks — The association
with a massive network, the millions of people online waiting to be
inspired, the focus on assembling the diverse &amp; exciting discussions
you won't find anywhere else — but it also has the bonus of having access to
the talented minds in the uWaterloo community. TEDxUW speakers come from all
walks of life, and in the past have included Olympic athletes, technological
savants, accomplished entrepreneurs and more, along with University of Waterloo
staff and students.<br><br></span>TEDxUW began in 2011, with the goal of bringing together the
most interesting members of the UW community to make a change in Waterloo.
Hosted by comic Ron Tite in the Humanities Theatre at Hagey Hall, the event was
a massive success, featuring speakers such as negotiation artist Dr. Wendi
Adair, wheelchair innovator Safwan Choudhury, and quantum physicist Krister
Shalm. Hundreds of people watched the show live, whether in person or online,
and since then the conference's videos have been viewed by millions. TEDxUW
2011 featured Larry Smith's “Why you will fail to have a great career” lecture, which currently has nearly 2 and a half million hits on TED's website
and was featured in a playlist of 6 speeches that became a phenomena in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>

In November 2012, TEDx returned to the university, this time
with TEDxUW being held in the Quantum Nano-Centre. The theme of the conference
was “EDGE”, with a focus on pushing the envelope and making the audience ask
themselves “What if?” The event was hosted by Denise Conlon,&nbsp;and featured presentations from local entrepreneur Michael Litt, Heather Moyse -&nbsp;who won the gold medal in 2010 for the women's bobsleigh competition -&nbsp;and UW
student Andrew Wong, among others.<br><br>This year's event will be on March 15, and instead of
happening on campus, the conference will be held at the Tannery Event Centre
adjoined to the Communitech Hub in downtown Kitchener. The 3,500+ sq. ft
convention space is a monument to both collaboration and modernization, created
by converting a former Waterloo mill into the state-of-the-art technology hub and&nbsp;conference
centre that&nbsp;it is today - with the help of provincial and national funding. It is the
perfect site for TEDxUW, an event that seeks to inspire others towards
innovation.<br><br>Sound interesting? Want to find out more? Keep coming to the
